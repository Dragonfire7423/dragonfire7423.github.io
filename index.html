<h2><i>What I've learned this semester and how I've applied it to my website</i></h2><br>

<p class=" box-shadow box roundcorners">Throughout this semester, I've spent a lot of time learning to use HTML, CSS, and more. Because of that, I wanted to dedicate the home page to basically what I've learned, with the remaining pages being used to showcase some of the stuff that I have learned. Below is a list of some of the more interesting stuff I've learned.</p><br><br>

<h2><em>Most Useful Topics I've Learned</em></h2>

<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Lists</li>
        <li>Boxes</li>
        <li>Images</li>
        <li>Videos</li>
        <li>Links</li>
        <li>Classes</li>
        <li>Column</li>
        <li>Gallery</li>
        <li>Websites</li>
    </ul><br>
</div>

<p class="box box-shadow roundcorners">In no particular order, some of the most useful HTML I've learned in this class starts with lists. Lists are super useful for making ordered or unordered lists, but I also saw through W3schools on how to use lists for the Navigation bar. Boxes are useful for lots but I found them most useful for highlighting content. Following that, learning how to put in images, whether it be by uploading them through github or uploading them through a link, videos, and links has been very useful. It allows me to be able to display the content I want in the way I want.</p>
<br>
<p class="box box-shadow roundcorners">This project in particular also taught me more on classes. Before, I understood you can make a class by putting a name after a dot but now I also know you can put something like div in front of a class and the class will only work on div and nothing else. For example, div.clear:after is one I had to learn in order to clear out space underneath my columns. Also learned how to setup a gallery. While a lot of that was basically emulating what lessons taught me, I now understand better how it all works.</p>
<br>
<p class="box box-shadow roundcorners">Lastly, being able to work on different website creators throughout the semester has let me be able to learn on how to use them and what good design might look like. Unfortunately, I still struggle a lot with colors and backgrounds but it's something I'll keep learning!</p>
