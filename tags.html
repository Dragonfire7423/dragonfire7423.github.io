<h1><b>Overwatch Metas</b></h1>
<h2><i>A brief summary of popular metas in the game, Overwatch</i></h2><br>

<p>Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter game. Referred to as a hero shooter, the game assigns players into a 6v6 format with each player allowed to pick a character with unique abilites. Those heroes, when paired with other heroes, can create synergy and form what is called a meta. A meta is a strategy agreed upon by the community that has the best chance/most optimal way of winning. Below is a list of popular metas and descriptions on certain popular metas</p><br><br>

<h2><em>Meta descriptions</em></h2>

<h2>Beyblade</h2>
<!--  -->
<p> The Beyblade meta comes from a Reaper player using their <a href="https://overwatch-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Blossom">Death Blossom</a> ultimate while boosted by an Ana player's ultimate, <a href="https://overwatch-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Nano_Boost">Nano Boost</a>. Effective at eliminating groups of enemy players</p>

<h2>GOATS</h2>
<!--  -->
<p>The GOATS meta is seen as the most oppressive meta to ever come to Overwatch. Consisting of primarily of Reinhardt, Zarya, Brigitte, Lucio, and D.Va, the composition focused on moving fast and doing overwhelming amounts of damage while rapid healing your own team. No previous meta could hold up to the aggressiveness of this new meta and it quickly took over. <sup>*Most disliked meta</sup></p>

<h2>Nanoblade</h2>
<!--  -->
<p>Nanoblade is a composition involving Genji and Ana, in where Genji uses his <a href="https://overwatch-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonblade">Dragonblade</a> with Ana's <a href="https://overwatch-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Nano_Boost">Nano Boost</a> in order to deal huge, single target damage. It's effective at dismantling teams by eliminating lower health targets and then winning the team fight by numbers advantage</p>

<h2>Dive</h2>
<!--  -->
<p>Dive meta is popular due to fast mobility heroes being able to dive into the enemy team and focusing down one target to secure the first kill. The comp primarily uses fast heroes like Winston, D.Va, Genji, and Tracer, who are all able to get in and out of fights easily</p>

<h2>Bunker</h2>
<!--  -->
<p>Bunker comp is a meta that is designed to be set up in a single location and build a defensive bunker that is hard to break though</p>
<!--  -->
<p>The comp revolves around Orisa primarily with primary damage dealers being the likes of heroes like Bastion, Soldier, or McCree. Healing wise, heroes like Baptiste who has excellent AoE healing or Mercy who has good single-target healing, help further fortify the bunker</p>

<h2>Double Shield</h2>
<!--  -->
<p>Double Shield composition uses Sigma and Orisa to have shields protecting the team at all times. It's a meta that gave rise to Doomfist, a hero that has one-shot combo abilities and can largely ignore shields</p>

<h2>Pharmercy</h2>
<!--  -->
<p>The Pharmercy meta, which comes from the two main heroes played in it, Pharah and Mercy, comes from the combination of the two heroes being able to stay in the air for extended periods of time, with the Mercy putting all resources into the Pharah. It allows Pharah to do lots of aerial damage and not die due to the Mercy providing constant healing</p><br>
